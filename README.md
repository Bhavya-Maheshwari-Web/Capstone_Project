# Capstone_Project

:: Ezz-Trip ::


This capstone project focuses on developing a web application that emulates the core functionalities of the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) platform.

The IRCTC-Clone aims to provide users with a streamlined experience for searching, booking, and managing train tickets. 
Key features will include user registration and authentication, real-time train search based on origin, destination, and date, seat availability display, secure payment gateway integration, and user dashboards for viewing booking history and managing reservations. 
The project will emphasize a user-friendly interface, robust backend architecture, and efficient database management to deliver a reliable and scalable railway ticketing simulation.
